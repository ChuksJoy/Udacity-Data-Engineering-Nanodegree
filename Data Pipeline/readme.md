# Project: NYC Data Analytics Platform on Azure Synapse Analytics

## Introduction

As a Data Engineer, I have been assigned an exciting project by the City of New York. The objective is to develop a robust Data Analytics platform using Azure Synapse Analytics on the Azure cloud. This platform will serve two primary purposes:

1. **Financial Resource Allocation Analysis:** The platform will enable the City to analyze the allocation of its financial resources, with a particular focus on overtime expenses. This analysis will help the City gain valuable insights into its budgetary distribution.

2. **Transparency for the Public:** The data will be made accessible to the public, allowing citizens to understand how the City's budget is spent on employee salaries and overtime pay across various municipal agencies.

## Project Scope

The project involves building dynamic, automated, and monitored data pipelines. The source data is stored in Azure Data Lake Gen2, and it needs to be processed in an NYC data warehouse within Azure Synapse Analytics. The source datasets consist of CSV files containing Employee master data and monthly payroll information from different City agencies.

## Project Resources

To accomplish this task, I will utilize various Azure resources, including:

- Azure Data Lake Gen2 (Storage account with Hierarchical Namespaces enabled)
- Azure SQL Database
- Azure Data Factory
- Azure Synapse Analytics

## Project Execution

Throughout the project, I will be working in the Azure Portal, setting up the required resources, creating data pipelines, and ensuring the platform's efficient operation. I will collaborate with the city's quality assurance experts, who will conduct testing to enhance overall data quality.

## Deliverables

As part of the project, I will take screenshots at key milestones to document the progress and provide proof of work. These screenshots will be essential for review and validation. A checklist will be used at the end of each step to ensure all deliverables are collected.

## Github Repository

To manage the project's code and resources effectively, I will create a dedicated Github repository. The repository will house all the code, configurations, and documentation related to the project.

## Conclusion

This project represents an exciting opportunity to contribute to the City of New York's data-driven decision-making process and enhance transparency for its citizens. I am eager to dive into the challenges and complexities of building this sophisticated Data Analytics platform on Azure Synapse Analytics.

Stay tuned for more updates and progress as I embark on this journey to make the City's financial data more accessible and insightful!
