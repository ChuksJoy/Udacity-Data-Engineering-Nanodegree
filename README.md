## Courses
### Data Modeling
In this course, you will find out how to create relational and NoSQL data models to fit the diverse needs of data consumers. Additionally, you’ll understand the differences between different data models and how to choose the appropriate data model for a given situation. Lastly, you’ll build fluency in PostgreSQL and Apache Cassandra.

### Cloud Data Warehouses with Azure
Learn to create cloud-based data warehouses, sharpen data warehousing skills, deepen knowledge of data infrastructure, and understand data engineering on the cloud using Azure.

### Data Lakes and Lakehouse with Spark and Azure Databricks
Learn about the big data ecosystem and how to use Spark to work with massive datasets. You will also store big data in a data lake and develop lakehouse architecture on the Azure Databricks platform.

### Data Pipelines with Azure
Learn to build, orchestrate, automate, and monitor data pipelines in Azure using Azure Data Factory and pipelines in Azure Synapse Analytics. Run data transformations, optimize data flows, and interact with data pipelines in production.

## Projects
In this section, you can find the projects I've completed as part of the Udacity Data Engineering program. Each project is located in its own directory and includes a detailed README with information about the project, its objectives, and the technologies used. Here's a list of the projects:

1. Project 1: Data Modeling with Apache Cassandra
Model user activity data for a music streaming app called Sparkify. Create a database and ETL pipeline in both Postgres and Apache Cassandra, designed to optimize queries for understanding what songs users are listening to. For Apache Cassandra, model the data to run specific queries provided by the analytics team at Sparkify.
2. Project 2: Building an Azure Data Warehouse for Bikeshare Data Analytics
Create a data warehouse solution using Azure Synaps Analytics to better understand Divvy, a bike-sharing program. Start by importing data into Synapse Analytics; then transform the data into a star schema, and view reports from Analytics to identify how much time and money is spent per ride.
3. Project 3: Building an Azure Data Lake for Bikeshare Data Analytics
Build a data lake solution for Divvy bikeshare with Azure Databricks using a lakehouse architecture. Design a star schema based on business outcomes and create a Bronze data store. Create a gold data store in Delta Lake tables and transform the data into the star schema for a Gold data store.
4. Project 4: Data Integration Pipelines for NYC Payroll Data Analytics
Analyze how the city's financial resources are allocated and how much of the city's budget is being devoted to overtime. Create high-quality data pipelines that are dynamic, so they can be automated and monitored for optimized efficiency. Build pipelines using Azure Data Factory for historical and new data to be processed in a NYC data warehouse in Azure Synapse Analytics.
6. Capstone Project: Building a Data Engineering Solution
